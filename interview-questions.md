# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: this is a special word referring to the state object in javascript

  Researched answer: the keyword 'this' in javascript lets you access a method's parent object; if used outside a method it lets you access something called the global object which in a web browser would be the window object. 



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: react is a front end javascript library developed by facebook. It is great for creating re usable javascript code pieces called components which let you put multiple html and css elements onto the webpage without writing code for each piece. 

  Researched answer: React is used to create interactive user interfaces that update and render when data changes. Components are created using a special syntax called JSX that take data input and displays something accordingly. 



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: in a javascript component you must include the render method 

  Researched answer: Render() is a required method in react components, it tells the browser what needs to be viewed(rendered). Something else that is special about it is that it is not user callable, and react naturally calls it during certain parts of a component's existance like when it is first ran in the code. 



4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a combination of javascript and html; one syntax difference between html is you are not able to use css classes on html elements the normal way and must declare them differently 

  Researched answer: JSX is a syntax for putting javascript expressions inside html that react renders to the web page through the DOM. 



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: yarn is a package manager for react javascript; all dependencies are updated when you run yarn

  Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager built by the internal people at facebook once their needs outgrew NPM the native package manager for node. When you run yarn it updates the files, functions and applications react and your dependencies need to function. 



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: an anonymous function in javascript is a function without a name that was never declared

  Researched answer: The difference between a function and an anonymous function is that an anonymous function is not named and thus not accessable after it has been created. For instance a javascript anonymous function could be used to immediately print a value to the console but cannot be invoked again. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering uses logical operators in react to update the UI; the most comparable thing in javascript would be the if else operators. 

2. Object-oriented programming: object orientated programming is focusing on classes and objects rather than functions. this works by creating classes which are able to create multiple objects with different attributes some of which are inherited from their parent class

3. Ruby: Ruby is an object orientated language that is interpreted. Being a interpreted language the code is read from top to bottom  and it was created to be object orientated to increase resuability. It's use cases are application, cloud, websites, automation, and servers. Ruby was made famous by the Rails application framework, which is a web framework. 

4. Ruby blocks: a ruby block is an anonymous function that can be passed into a method which is a function that belongs to an object; blocks are either implicit or explicit. explicit blocks are named that can either be saved or used in another method. 

5. Ruby hashes: hashes are multiple key value pairs stored in one value called a hash, the index is not integer based though thus there is not a value at 0 or 1 or 2 locations.
